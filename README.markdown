<a href="http://www.selectorgadget.com">SelectorGadget</a> is an open source bookmarklet that makes CSS selector generation and discovery on complicated sites a breeze. Tools such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/">Hpricot</a>, and <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html">CSS selectors</a> to navigate, modify, and extract content from HTML and XHTML data. Just drag the bookmarklet to your bookmark bar, then go to any page and press it.  A box will open in the bottom right of the website.  Click on a page element that you would like your selector to match (will turn green). SelectorGadget will then generate a minimal CSS selector for that element, and will highlight (yellow) everything that is matched by the selector. Now click on a highlighted element to remove it from the selector (red), or click on an unhighlighted element to add it to the selector. Through this process of selection and rejection, SelectorGadget helps you come up with the perfect CSS selector for your needs.

TODO:
- Use jQuery mode that won't use $
- Cascade script loading with loop instead of with script onload since IE sucks.
